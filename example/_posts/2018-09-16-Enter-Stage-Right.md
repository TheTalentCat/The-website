Hello World

Welcome to the home of the Talent Cat.

It's been a long time since I've made a website. So things are looking pretty simple right now. That will soon change. Things are under construction for now :D

Maybe you're wondering why I'm embarking on this project?

I want to help recruiters and candidates come to a better understanding of one other. I have a unique perspective of their relationship to one another because I work for an ATS (Applicant Tracking System). An ATS is the software that recruiters use to screen, evaluate, and decide on which candidates to move forward. My daily work involves listening to HR professionals talk about their hiring woes, and advising them on how they can increase their efficiency with the ATS my company provides. I have had thousands of these conversations with companies of all sizes and industries. Most of these clients have been in North America, but I've also consulted plenty of folks in South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.

As I have these conversations, I remember the times when I myself was a struggling professional looking to carve out a place in this world for himself. My first job was minimum wage. My first "career role" 10 years ago was only part time at $15/hour. In 2008, I set a pace for myself to double my income every 5 years and have succeeded with room to spare so far. Getting to where I am now involved tons of self-investment, hundreds of customized resumes + cover letters, lots of application forms, plenty of interviews, and a mountain of rejection. It's hard!

So what does this mean for our relationship as I tap these words?

It means our success is mutual. Make me successful by reading, commenting, and sharing your favorite works of mine. I need to get this message out but I can't do it without your help. I will make you successful by increasing your competitiveness as a candidate or recruiter, whichever you are. This blog will cater to both.

Ready for success?

If your answer is yes, see you soon...
