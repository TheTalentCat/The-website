Hello World...

I am not a recruiter. But I know the world of recruitment.
I am not a job seeker. But I know the world of job seeking.

I am your friend who walks on the fence. My home lies betwixt two worlds. I am your secret connection to the whispers on the other side.

I am a talent cat.

Every day, I listen to HR professionals talk about their hiring woes, and advise them on the best path forward with what my company provides. As I have these conversations, I remember when I too sought to carve out a place in this world. The journey from minimum wage to prosperity is by no means simple nor easy.

I know where I am, but where are you on that journey?

Wherever you are, whatever your skills, no matter your gifts or lack thereof, know this.

You can do it.

So what does this mean for our relationship as I tap these words?

It means our success is mutual.

Read my words, voice your comments, and share your favorite works of mine. Together, we can make the worlds of hiring a better place.

Ready for success? Or at the very least, something better?

If so, then look at my next post, and accept my challenge.

You won't regret it...
