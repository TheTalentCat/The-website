Hello World...

Welcome to the home of the Talent Cat.

Are you a human who wants a better job? Or are you a human who wants to do a better job as an HR professional?

If you are either of these kinds of humans, I want to help you. I have a unique perspective on the hiring relationship because I work for an ATS (Applicant Tracking System). For you humans who do not know what an ATS is, an ATS is the software that recruiters use to screen, evaluate, and decide on which candidates to move forward. My daily work involves listening to HR professionals talk about their hiring woes. I advise them on how they can increase their efficiency with the ATS my company provides. As of today I have had approximately ~5000 of these kinds of conversations.

As I have these conversations, I remember the times when I myself was a struggling human looking to carve out a place in this world for himself. My first job was minimum wage. My first "career role" 10 years ago was part time at $15/hour. In 2008, I set a pace for myself to double my income every 5 years and have succeeded with room to spare so far. Getting to where I am now was hard.

So what does this mean for our relationship as I tap these words?

It means our success is mutual. I would like to make the path less hard for you. Make me successful by reading, commenting, and sharing your favorite works of mine. I will make you successful by increasing your competitiveness as a candidate or recruiter, whichever you are. This blog will cater to both.

Ready for success?

If your answer is yes, see you soon...
