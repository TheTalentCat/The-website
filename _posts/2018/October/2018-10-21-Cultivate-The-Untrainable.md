Untrainable skills are part of what make you unique.

Untrainable does not mean unattainable. Rather, the self-effort it takes to cultivate means that such qualities are rare. I still recall a conversation from one of my wisest managers who explained it this way.

There are three kinds of challenges.

1. **There is the challenge of the head**. If one of my employees does not know something, I can teach him the facts, concepts, and principles.
2. **There is also the challenge of the hand**. Perhaps my employee knows something, but does not have what he needs to get it done. As an employer, it is my duty to equip my team with every tool their hand needs, plus provide the training and time to master those tools.
3. **The challenge of the heart** is another beast altogether. I can give knowledge, and I can give tools, but I cannot make them care from deep inside. I can reward, I can punish, I can plead, I can threaten, I can beg, I can fire and replace. But I cannot control the heart. I would rather hire someone who has a good heart and no qualifications, than to hire someone with the qualifications but is a stench to the operation with their rotten insides. **A person with a rotten heart can destroy my entire operation**.

It's amusing in light of this understanding to look at typical job advertisements and resumes alike who use trite phrases about the state of the heart, as if it were a mere afterthought.

*Self-driven*

*Hard working*

*Motivated*

*Diligent*

The experienced sees such banality, rolls their eyes, and moves on.




 One of my colleagues ruminates on this concept in [this brilliant article](https://hunterhansen.net/2018/10/18/the-life-autistic-can-empathy-be-learned/?fbclid=IwAR10vg_xIi0qOd9lQQIQ6basUSsEB0UZnc1IFoUsM3hf_Rp8zkit6N0_PW4) about his own journey to cultivate his own untrainable skill.
