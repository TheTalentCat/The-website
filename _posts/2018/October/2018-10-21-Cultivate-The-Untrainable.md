Untrainable skills are what make you unique. They are the qualities in a candidate that can make them uniquely suited to a role.

Untrainable does not mean unattainable. Rather, it's a type of skill that cannot be easily nor reliably instilled into others. I still recall a conversation from one of my managers who explained it this way.

There are three kinds of challenges.

1. **There is the challenge of the head**. If one of my employees does not know something, I can teach him the facts, concepts, and principles.
2. **There is also the challenge of the hand**. Perhaps my employee knows something, but does not have what he needs to get it done. As an employer, it is my duty to equip my team with every tool their hand needs, plus provide the training and time to master those tools.
3. **The challenge of the heart** is another beast altogether. I can give someone knowledge, and I can give someone tools, but I cannot make them care from deep inside. They might use the knowledge and tools I give them for the good of the operation. I can reward their good work and punish their bad work. I can plead, I can threaten, I can beg, I can fire and replace. But I cannot control the heart. I would rather hire someone who has a good heart and no qualifications, than to hire someone with the qualifications but is a stench to the operation with their rotten insides. **A person with a rotten heart can destroy my entire operation**.

It's amusing in light of this understanding to look at typical job advertisements on popular job boards like Indeed and CareerBuilder where companies list quality after quality of what they desire even for unskilled roles, and practically every qualification relates to what the candidate knows and what they can do. The attention given to matters of the heart are often limited to buzzwords; a mere afterthought.

 One of my colleagues ruminates on this concept in [this brilliant article](https://hunterhansen.net/2018/10/18/the-life-autistic-can-empathy-be-learned/?fbclid=IwAR10vg_xIi0qOd9lQQIQ6basUSsEB0UZnc1IFoUsM3hf_Rp8zkit6N0_PW4) about his own journey to cultivate his own untrainable skill.
