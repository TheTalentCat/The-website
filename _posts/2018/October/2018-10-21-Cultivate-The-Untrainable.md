Untrainables are part of what make you unique. Emotional intelligence, soft skills, whatever you want to call it...untrainables are the part of you that no one can change.

Except for maybe you.

*Some untrainables are more desirable than others*

I still recall a conversation from one of my wisest managers who put it like this.

There are three kinds of challenges.

1. **There is the challenge of the head**. If one of my employees does not know something, I can teach him the facts, concepts, and principles.
2. **There is also the challenge of the hand**. Perhaps my employee knows something, but does not have what he needs to get it done. As an employer, it is my duty to equip my team with every tool + training their hands need.
3. **The challenge of the heart** is another beast altogether. I can give knowledge, and I can give tools, but I cannot make them care from deep inside. I can reward, I can punish, I can plead, I can threaten, I can beg, I can fire and replace. But I cannot control the heart.

He went on to say,

>I would rather hire someone who has a good heart and no qualifications, than to hire the technically qualified person who carries a stench into the operation with their rotten insides.
>**A hire with a terrible heart can destroy my entire operation**.

*The legacy of a person with a terrible heart is clouded with broken relationships, permanent instability, and perpetual sabotage. If your legacy begins to look like a villain's lair in some animated film that probably stars bears who care or colorful little ponies, then it's time to cultivate better untrainables.*

It's amusing in light of this understanding to look at typical job advertisements and resumes alike that treat the state of the heart as if it were a mere afterthought with one word bullet points.

*Self-driven*

*Experienced*

*Motivated*

*Diligent*

Bah.

If you don't see significant value placed on the untrainables in a job advertisement, you're going to likely end up working with a lot of rotten coworkers.

Why?

**Because you'll be working with people at a place where the untrainables don't matter to the folks in charge**.

The companies with better work environment will spend effort to discuss what those untrainable skills should look like in action within their operation. If you want to be a living legend, and work with amazing people to achieve meaningful impact on the world, then heed my call.

**Sacrifice the parts of yourself that are mediocre until you are immensely desirable**. **Then raise similar standards for any company that you would be willing to apply for work**.

Untrainable does not mean unattainable. Rather, the self-effort it takes to cultivate desirable untrainables means that such qualities are uncommon, often rare, potentially epic, and can make you legendary. If you're looking for inspiration, let me point you towards two shining examples to imitate.

1. A stellar client I worked with has [job advertisements](https://simprints.recruiterbox.com/) that show how to do it right in looking for candidates with the right untrainables.
2. A friend of mine [shares his own personal journey to cultivate an untrainable](https://hunterhansen.net/2018/10/18/the-life-autistic-can-empathy-be-learned/?fbclid=IwAR10vg_xIi0qOd9lQQIQ6basUSsEB0UZnc1IFoUsM3hf_Rp8zkit6N0_PW4) which did not come naturally for him.
