If you're not making at least $100k/year, this article series is for you.

Maybe you've heard before how to get there. _The fastest way to make big money is to start your own business_. Does that make you queasy? Are you quick to point out that the other half of that reality is that starting your own business is also the _riskiest way_ to $100k? Do you despair that you're just not cut out for that kind of life?

If so, I have good news! This blog isn't here to re-invent <h href="https://sweatystartup.com/">Sweaty Startup</a>. There's no shame to accept you're not cut out to be a business owner. It's ok to carve out a six figure income while slaving away for The Manâ„¢.

The tradeoff for more predictable success is **less risk** but **more time**.

Some folks veer hard to maximize predictability. They go and get a degree in a high demand field. They settle down with their prom sweetheart, have 2.5 kids, and move a few miles down the road from their parents into a nice home with a white picket fence. They don't ask questions. They do the same thing the same way at the same place for 40 years.

Does that path sound equally unappealing to you? _I wasn't that kind of cat either_. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life for a long time. I envied the confidence of those folks who had it all figured out, but I didn't envy how monotonous their path would be. And then when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_losses_caused_by_the_Great_Recession">bottom dropped out of the economy in 2007-2010</a> for many of those folks, I learned that their path had risks after all.

Corporate executives of big dollar companies<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/05/its-golden-parachute-season/328115/"> will desert you in a heartbeat </a> and pay themselves a bonus in the process! When recession comes, stability is a mirage.

I passed on both paths. Instead, I carved out the path of the talent cat. A path not as risky as the entrepreneur, but not as predictable as a corporate ladder.

Yes it is.</a></p>

**I'm living proof.**

I came from one of the poorest and <a href="https://www.greenwichtime.com/technology/businessinsider/article/Bill-Gates-says-where-you-were-born-is-the-14449868.php">overall lowest rated regions</a> in the United States. I clawed my way up in the middle of the worst modern recession in world history.

In the span of 10 years, I doubled my income twice.

Want to do likewise? You can. Read on as I continue this series. I'm going to show you the path from start to success.
