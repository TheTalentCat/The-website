X is the number of people who are searching for a solution like the one you provide at any given time.

Out of X, only M will find you. That's marketing.

Out of M, only S will buy from you. That's sales.

Out of S, only Z will completely onboard with you. That's success.

Out of Z, only P will get better results from your solution. That's product.

Out of P, only C will be happy with your solution. That's customer support.

Out of C, only F will confidently recommend your business. That's reputation.

Out of F, X to M will either grow or die.

Want more X over your competitors?

Press F. That's leadership.
