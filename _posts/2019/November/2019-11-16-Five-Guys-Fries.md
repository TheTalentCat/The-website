The first time I ever went to a Five Guys restaurant, I tried to order a large fry. The cashier gave me a look üòè

"Is this your first time? Look over there."

She pointed over to her co-worker busy stuffing a whole extra scoop of fries into a customer's bag.

"That's a small fry. You still want a large?"

I laughed. I didn't want a large after all.

Looking back now with what I've learned about business, I'm astonished at the simple brilliance.

This extra dose of generosity is mandated from the top. The extra fries are what they're known for. You probably knew how this story was going to end because you already know the reputation of Five Guys.

If your business were a burger joint, what would people say about your fries, if anything?
