Have you ever made a big purchase that you regretted?

A bad software purchase can cost you your job and forever impact your company. I want to help you never make a bad software purchase ever again!

I've been in Sales for 10 years now and I love what I do.

I've worked every angle of the customer-facing side of business -- sales, support, success, and account management.

I've worked every kind of business relationship --startups to enterprise.

It makes me very happy when I see people thriving because of my help.

In my upcoming series on how to purchase software, I will hit every phase of the process.

1. How to know if you need a solution
2. How to research software solutions
3. How to screen software for the right fit
4. How to get your coworkers on board
5. How to negotiate the best price
6. How to deploy with success
