Have you ever made a big purchase that you regretted?

A bad software purchase can cost you your job and forever impact your company. I want to help you never make a bad software purchase ever again!

I've been in Sales for 10 years now and I love what I do.

I've worked every angle of the customer-facing side of business -- sales, support, success, and account management.

I've worked every kind of business relationship --startups to enterprise.

It makes me very happy when I see people thriving because of my help.

In my upcoming series on how to purchase software, I will hit every phase of the process.

✅ How to know if you need a solution
✅ How to research software solutions
✅ How to screen software for the right fit
✅ How to get your coworkers on board
✅ How to negotiate the best price
✅ How to deploy with success
