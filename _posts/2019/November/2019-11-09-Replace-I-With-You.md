A good exercise is to review any #email you write for the word "I", and try to find a way to rewrite it with "you" instead.


For example,

"I wanted to reach out to see if you were ready to schedule that technical demo about our API. I can be ready by next week if that's okay"

vs.

"You asked for that technical demo for how your essential systems will play nicely with ours. How does 45mins next Tuesday around 2 or 3pm your time work for you?"

Make your message about your customer. Show them you care about what they care about!
