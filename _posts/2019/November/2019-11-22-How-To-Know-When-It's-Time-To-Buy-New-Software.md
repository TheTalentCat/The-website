Do you ever get that nagging feeling that something's wrong in your business, but you're not sure what's wrong or how to fix it?

Here's how to tell if you could likely fix your problems with better software.

1. Your team isn't using the software you already have. Check if folks are using alternatives to bypass the software that's already in place.

2. Your team is repeatedly doing the same kind of task at length. Check how much time âŒš folks are spending on repetitive tasks to identify where you stand to gain the most.

3. You hear complaints from any stakeholder (customers, coworkers, etc.) about communication problems. Issues like forgotten deadlines, missed messages, and scheduling woes can be smoothed out with the right software.

4. You notice sudden drops in your company metrics. Conversions down? Competitors seem to be more successful than you? Maybe they're using tools that you don't know about!

5. You feel like you have to go through a lot of trouble to make informed decisions. If you're spending hours to build custom reports or transfer data across multiple systems, it's time to upgrade!
