*The essence of the independent mind lies not in what it thinks, but in how it thinks.*
--Christopher Hitchens, Letters to a Young Contrarian


Everyone thinks, but not everyone thinks correctly.

The above image is from a fun experiment -- the artist went back to redraw one of his old works. You might notice a difference between the two. I can't think of a better way to illustrate the thinking of a person who understands logic vs. someone who doesn't.

Logic is the process of placing thoughts in order. There are many ways to see logic in action.

>-The fool stacks their papers on their desk. The logical file their papers away as they are processed.

>-The fool tackles tasks at random. The logical execute a step by step plan.

>-The fool dishes out word salads when prompted to speak. The logical speak with clarity, direction, flow, and purpose.

Think about how you think. Do you feel like you are logical?

Whatever your answer, it doesn't matter. [People largely make their choices on emotion, not logic](https://bigthink.com/experts-corner/decisions-are-emotional-not-logical-the-neuroscience-behind-decision-making).

Humans are NOT logical creatures by default.

This does not mean that logic is impossible. It does mean that being logical requires intentional choices that will go against the grain of your natural inclinations. When your gut feeling is wrong, logic will tell you why.

Logic has a well defined structure. In the same way you can you can look at a sentence and pick out the nouns, verbs, and punctuation, you can typically know with 100% certainty if a thought or statement is logical.

What does learning logic do for you? Why would anyone make the effort if it sometimes goes against what feels right?



1. **Logic is a foundational discipline.** Every craft and trade, from pottery to programming, uses logic extensively.

2. **Logic protects you from being misled.** Logic cuts through cons, scams, and lies.

3. **Logic enables new levels of discovery and learning.** You will see what others cannot, and gain new levels of confidence.



Convinced? Great! Logic has persuaded you to undertake the study of, well, logic!

Before we go deeper, be forewarned.

_You may find that applying logic to your life will take you into unsettling conclusions. The study of logic may cause you to question aspects of your life that you had always assumed._

_Are you willing to accept the consequences of the pursuit of truth?_

_You will come out better, but you will not be the same._
