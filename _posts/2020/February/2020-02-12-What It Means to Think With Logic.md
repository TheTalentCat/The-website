*[The essence of the independent mind lies not in what it thinks, but in how it thinks.](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/346391)*

#### Everyone thinks, but not everyone thinks correctly.

The above image is from a fun experiment. The artist [Miles](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5j0eyq/two_self_portraits_i_drew_from_a_mirror_10_years/) went back at age 23 to redraw his self-portrait from when he was 13. You might notice a difference between the two. The comparison of _someone untrained in logic vs. an expert_ can be just as drastic.

It's not that there's no logic in how the artist produced the first picture. You can see the picture is of a person, with appropriately placed facial features. There's even a little shadowing to draw distinction in the face. No question, it's a human face all right. All the basics are there.

And yet, you'd never for a second be fooled that it is anything more than a poor facsimile of a person. No offense, Miles, but that pic's about as skillfully put together as the average Youtube comment.

But that second picture though. Miles. My man. It's downright photo-realistic! We could slap that on the side of a milk carton and find you in a hot minute!

As you master logic, the grammar of decision making becomes known to you, just like Miles mastered the artistry of the self-portrait. In a drawing of this caliber, there are all kinds of techniques applied that teenage Miles never even knew to use. Hatching. Cross-hatching. Stippling. Fixatives. Blending. Texturing. Light source placement. Negative space management. I'm sure adult Miles could list more.

In the same way, logic has its own techniques. Just like Miles' teenage skills produced a picture that can pass for a person, untrained logic can get you by in life. But you will endeavor with a lot of trial and error as you "reinvent wheels" others already discovered long ago. Wouldn't it be great to know what those logic techniques are by name, how they work, and when they are appropriate to be used? You'll honestly be able to say you know what you're doing, and why.

#### So what is logic?

Logic is the process of placing thoughts in order. There are many ways to see logic in action.

>**The one who stacks their desk with papers** vs. **The one who files their completed work.**

>**The one who tackles tasks at random** vs. **The one who executes a step by step plan.**

>**The one who speaks in word salads** vs. **The one who speaks with clarity, flow, and purpose.**

Think about how you think. Do you feel like you are logical?

Perhaps you said yes?

Careful. Humans are NOT logical creatures by default. [People largely make their choices on emotion, not logic.](https://bigthink.com/experts-corner/decisions-are-emotional-not-logical-the-neuroscience-behind-decision-making)

This does not mean that logic is impossible. It does mean that being logical requires intentional choices that will go against the grain of your natural inclinations. When your gut feeling is wrong, logic will tell you why.

What does learning logic do for you?



1. **Logic is a foundational discipline.** Every craft and trade, from pottery to programming, uses logic extensively.

2. **Logic protects you from being misled.** Logic cuts through cons, scams, and lies.

3. **Logic enables new levels of discovery and learning.** You will see what others cannot, and gain new levels of confidence.


Convinced? Great! Logic has persuaded you to undertake the study of, well, logic!

Logic has a well defined structure. In the same way you can look at a sentence and pick out the nouns, verbs, and punctuation, you can typically know with 100% certainty if a thought or statement is logical.

Before we go deeper, be forewarned. You may find that applying logic to your own life will take you into unexpected realizations. The study of logic may cause you to question old assumptions that have been previously unexamined.

If that ends up being you, don't panic.

You will come out better, but you will not be the same.
