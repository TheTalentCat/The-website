Logic and martial arts have a lot in common.

In martial arts, choreographed movement routines are practiced as a way to memorize and perfect one's technique. These movement routines, known as **katas** (åž‹ or å½¢; meaning "form"), come in many styles.

Elegant, flowing weapon dance.

Furious flurries of fists and feet.

Drunken staggering that suckers an opponent into a suprised stupor.

And moves that just plain look cool.

Logic has its own kind of kata. We call them **syllogisms**.

So what is a syllogism?

>A syllogism is a deduction in the form of a formal argument. It contains three parts.
1. A major premise
2. A minor premise
3. A conclusion

I know what you're thinking.

"Dude...I just came for the logic kung fu so I can start trashing bozos over politics on Facebook. Are we there yet?"

No, we're not there yet.

You gotta crawl before you walk. You gotta walk before you can trash bozos. Trust me, I'm saving you from a lot of mistakes, my friend.

Stay with me here. I'm about to teach you your first logic attack. **The premise**.

So what's a premise?

A premise is a proposition that we assume to be true in our syllogism. Here's some premise examples.

 _All planets are made of dirt._

_Nobody wants Baby Yoda to die._

_Your mom is fat._

Oof. Did you feel that last one?

A premise is like a punch or kick in your logic kata. We aren't trashing bozos or triple kicking boards yet, but hey! We can do some damage now!

We're gonna use some of these terms a lot down the road, so I'll start abbreviating. We'll call Conclusion "Conk" for short.

#### When we form a syllogism, we use two different premises in order to form a Conk.

- Minor premise (ps) -- A proposition with the subject of the conclusion.
- Major premise (PP)-- A proposition with the predicate of the conclusion.

Both premises will share a common middle term (MT). Think of the MT as their mutual friend in the middle.

Just so you know, the MT and the Conk don't hang out.

Here's an example of a syllogism.

**Bananas are healthy food. Many people love bananas. Therefore, many people love some healthy food.**

>
- PP = Bananas (MT) are healthy food.
- ps = Many people love bananas(MT).
- Conk = Therefore, many people love some healthy food.

Pretty simple, right? When you look at a perfectly constructed syllogism, like this one, we can say that it is a valid syllogism.

However, it's very easy for a syllogism to be invalid.

**First, maybe the common sense is wrong.**

Like this penguin.

#### Second, sometimes the common sense of the syllogism seems to be okay, but **maybe the construction itself is wrong.**

For example, maybe two karate guys are fighting in a tournament, and hard face blows are illegal. If one guy kicks the other guy in the face as hard as he can, it doesn't matter what happens after that. Even if he continues through the motions of beating his opponent, he's already lost, because he KICKED THE OTHER GUY IN THE FACE AND SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED.

Here are six rules for how to tell.

#### **Every syllogism...**
>
1. Must have exactly three categorical terms.
2. Must use the MT correctly.
3. Must have a conk that uses the terms from the PP and ps correctly.
4. Must be negative if either the PP or the ps is negative.
5. Can't have both a negative PP and a negative ps.
6. Can't have a PP and a ps that are both universal. (i.e. can't use "all" in both premises)

Don't stress too much on these for now. We'll cross those bridges when we get there. Just know that even if the common sense seems okay, the logic can still be broken.

So there you have it. Your syllogisms are your katas in logic. If you get your katas right, you can say that you are being logical. As you get used to them, you'll start seeing them in your every day conversation. They've always been there. You've been using them all this time and never knew it!

Don't get cocky. You've only taken your first step my friend.

There's battles going on all around you. Wars of ideas. Campaigns of persuasion. Struggles to claim your heart, soul, and wallet. Some are good, and some are good at swindling you.

Do you want to defend yourself from deception? Discern error? Fight for truth? Trash political bozos on Facebook?

Learn the katas. Master the syllogism. Take a step into a much larger world that has always been there around you.

You might be amazed at what conversational triple kicks you'll pull off someday.
