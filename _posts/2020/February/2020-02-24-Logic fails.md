It's very easy for a syllogism to be invalid.

**First, maybe the common sense is wrong.**

Like the penguin above. If you're the top that feels like you're logical already, you probably already have this one down. The skeleton of the syllogism itself is solid, but the meaning is absurd.

#### Second, sometimes the common sense of the syllogism seems to be okay, but **maybe the construction itself is wrong.**

For example, maybe two karate guys are fighting in a tournament, and hard face blows are illegal. If one guy kicks the other guy in the face as hard as he can, it doesn't matter what happens after that. Even if he continues through the motions of beating his opponent, he's already lost, because he KICKED THE OTHER GUY IN THE FACE AND SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED.

The key takeaway is that even if the common sense seems okay, the logic can still be disqualified. Just like Ralph Macchio should have been disqualified with that crane kick to the face.

There are six rules for how to tell if the construction of a syllogism is wrong.

#### 1) Every syllogism must have exactly three categorical terms.

Maybe you're thinking, "Shucks, that's easy!"

*Derp derp, count to three.*

There's more than one way to take this rule. The tricky thing about language is that sometimes the same word can have multiple definitions. Take a look at this syllogism.

>
- Dustin has that car.
- That car has bad gas.
- Therefore, Dustin has bad gas.

This syllogism seems to have three terms. Dustin, car, and gas. But we pulled the ol' switcheroo on one of those words, didn't we?

*Just get it all out, you'll feel better baby*

#### 2) Every syllogism must distribute the middle term in at least one of the premises.

There's gotta be a genuine connection between the major and minor term. It's like a parent holding their kid's hand. If they don't hold on, then the kid is liable to get separated and cause mayhem.

>
- Kids are trouble.
- Parents are trouble.
- Therefore, all parents are kids.

While it could be argued that at least some parents are just big kids, that has nothing to do with our syllogism here. Someone must be the adult in the room and make sure the middle term always gets distributed.

#### 3) Every syllogism must have a conclusion that uses the terms from the major premise and minor premise correctly.


#### 4) Every syllogism must be negative if either the major premise or the minor premise is negative.


#### 5) No syllogism can have both a negative major premise and a negative minor premise.


#### 6) No syllogism can have a major premise and a minor premise that are both universal.
