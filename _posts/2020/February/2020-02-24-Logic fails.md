It's very easy for a syllogism to be invalid.

**First, maybe the common sense is wrong.**

Like this penguin.

#### Second, sometimes the common sense of the syllogism seems to be okay, but **maybe the construction itself is wrong.**

For example, maybe two karate guys are fighting in a tournament, and hard face blows are illegal. If one guy kicks the other guy in the face as hard as he can, it doesn't matter what happens after that. Even if he continues through the motions of beating his opponent, he's already lost, because he KICKED THE OTHER GUY IN THE FACE AND SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED.

Here are six rules for how to tell.

#### **Every syllogism...**
>
1. Must have exactly three categorical terms.
2. Must use the MT correctly.
3. Must have a conk that uses the terms from the PP and ps correctly.
4. Must be negative if either the PP or the ps is negative.
5. Can't have both a negative PP and a negative ps.
6. Can't have a PP and a ps that are both universal. (i.e. can't use "all" in both premises)

Don't stress too much on these for now. We'll cross those bridges when we get there. Just know that even if the common sense seems okay, the logic can still be broken.
