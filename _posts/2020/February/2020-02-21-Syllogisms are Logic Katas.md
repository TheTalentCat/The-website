Logic and martial arts have a lot in common.

In martial arts, choreographed movement routines are practiced as a way to memorize and perfect one's technique. These movement routines, known as katas (型 or 形; meaning "form"), come in many styles.

Elegant, flowing weapon dance.

Furious flurries of fists and feet.

Humorous, drunken-like staggering that deceives one into vulnerable ease.

And stuff that just plain looks cool.

While katas are truly a sight to behold, at a second glance you might realize they seem to be kinda useless. Let's face it, the guy triple-kicking the boards sure looks slick, but it's highly unlikely he's gonna get a chance to kick three heads perfectly lined up like that.

Logic has its own kind of kata. We call them syllogisms.

So what is a syllogism?

>A syllogism is a deductive scheme of a formal argument consisting of a major and a minor premise and a conclusion.
