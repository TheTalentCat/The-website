Logic and martial arts have a lot in common.

In martial arts, choreographed movement routines are practiced as a way to memorize and perfect one's technique. These movement routines, known as katas (型 or 形; meaning "form"), come in many styles.

Elegant, flowing weapon dance.

Furious flurries of fists and feet.

Humorous, drunken-like staggering that deceives one into vulnerable ease.

And stuff that just plain looks cool.

Logic has its own kind of kata. We call them syllogisms.

#### So what is a syllogism?

>A syllogism is a deduction in the form of a formal argument. It contains three parts.
1. A minor premise
2. A major premise
3. A conclusion

I know what you're thinking.

Dude...I just came for the kung fu so I can start trashing bozos over politics on Facebook. Are we there yet?

No, we're not there yet.

You gotta crawl before you walk. You gotta walk before you can trash bozos. Trust me, I'm saving you a lot of pain and embarrassment, my friend.

Stay with me here. I'm about to teach you your first logic punch.

#### So what's a premise?

A premise is a proposition that we assume to be true in our syllogism. Here's some examples.

 _All planets are made of dirt._

_Nobody wants Baby Yoda to die._

_Your mom is fat._

Oooh, did you feel that last one?

A premise is like a punch or kick of your logic kata. We aren't trashing bozos or triple kicking boards yet, but it's a start.

When we form a syllogism, we use two premises.

Major premise

While katas are truly a sight to behold, at a second glance you might realize they seem to be kinda useless. Let's face it, the guy triple-kicking the boards sure looks slick, but it's highly unlikely he's gonna get a chance to kick three heads perfectly lined up like that.
